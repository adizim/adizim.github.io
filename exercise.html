	<h3>Fitness</h3>

	<p>I spend a lot of time exercising or reading about fitness. The activities that I have stuck to over the years are running, swimming, basketball, and weightlifting. I try to maintain a balanced split of cardiovascular training and weightlifting every week, though I usually lean more towards weightlifting.
	</p>

	<p>My current routine involves a PPL weightlifting program (push/pull/legs), low intensity running, and sprints.</p>

	<p>My favorites for fitness literature and knowledge, in no particular order</p>
