	<h3>My Music "Career"</h3>

	<p>In the 5th grade, I started playing the clarinet. That simple decision has led to some of the greatest experiences of my life.</p>

	<p>In the band scene, I was able to receieve 1st chair in the top group at California All-State for five consecutive years. I also accompanied Homestead High School's top band to a stunning tour in Eastern Europe. 
	</p>

	<p>In middle school, I was introduced to symphony through the El Camino Youth Symphony (now called Golden State Youth Symphony), and it became a central activity in my life. I was awarded a couple concertos with the group and went on an amazing tour with them too. In the junior year of high school, I earned one of four clarinet positions in the distinguished San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra. Playing in the historic Davies Symphony Hall every Saturday was unforgettable.</p>

	<p>My journey brought me to the farthest corners of the world to play in fancy halls with close friends. These times constitute my fondest memories. Above all, I learned the value of deeply honing a craft and the satisfaction that progress can bring. I strive for the same level of commitment in developing other crafts such as programming.

	<p>An eternally grateful thank you goes to my parents and my teacher, Debra Gardner, for their unwavering support and guidance.</p>
