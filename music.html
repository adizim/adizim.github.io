	<h2>My Music "Career"</h2>

	<p>In the 5th grade, I started playing the clarinet. That simple decision has led to some of the greatest experiences of my life.</p>

	<p>In the band scene, I was able to receieve 1st chair in the top group at California All-State for five consecutive years. I accompanied my high school band to a stunning tour in Eastern Europe. </p>

	<p>In middle school, I was introduced to symphony through the El Camino Youth Symphony (now called Golden State Youth Symphony), and it became a central activity in my life. I was awarded a couple concertos with the group and went on an amazing tour with them. In the junior year of high school, I earned one of four clarinet positions in the distinguished San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra. Playing in one of the world's finest youth symphonies in the historic Davies Symphony Hall was unforgettable.</p>

	<p>My journey brought me to the farthest corners of the world to play in fancy halls with close friends. These times constitute my fondest memories. Above all, I learned the value of deeply honing a craft for many years and the satisfaction that can bring. I try to strive for the same level of commitment in developing other crafts, such as programming</p>

	<p>An eternally grateful thank you goes to my parents and close teacher, Debra Gardner, for their support during my music "career".</p>
